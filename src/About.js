        the infection simulator was conceived during the covid19 lockdown of
        2020. it's purpose is to give just a sense of what protective measures
        could do to "flatten the curve" on the spread of virii.

      <div className="spacer" />
      <div>
        i think it's achieved that result even though it's a very basic
        simulator for both human and virii behaivor.

        the people (i call them "pips") in this sim have very simple behavior
        about the environment around them. they are social creatures and will
        always feel a pull toward the mid point location of the people around
        them and will adjust accordingly to move there. there is also a pull for
        these pips to go toward the average trajectory of the pips around them.
      </div>

        they also have a limit to how fast they are able to change their
        direction.
      </div>
      <div className="spacer" />
      <div>
        the virii behavior is extremely simple in that when an infected pip gets
        close enough to another pip, it will infect that new pip.
